# Title and Backcover
###
ROMCOM is a site which creates any bad paperback romance novel you want and can randomly populate its own covers as well, complete with images, cheesy titles, and corny taglines.

ROMCOM was built using using Atom, git workflow, and HTML and CSS provided by Turing.

## Project Status
###
The functionality to use the site is complete, however the site has not been tested thoroughly for user generated errors.

## Reflection
###
ROMCOM is the product of [Orlando Murcio](github.com/atos20) and [Greyson Elkins](github.com/GreysonElkins) and it was completed as their first paired project in Module 1 at the Turing School of Software and Design. It's an excersize in JavaScript methods which interact with HTML by manipulating the DOM with data saved in the Data Model.

The primary methods we used and learned from the project had to do with selecting elements from the HTML and CSS documents and manipulating them. We also developed an understanding of the data model and used it to save data and use it in multiple places; this was especially challenging as we worked through different iterations and worked to maintain SRP and DRY, but we feel we were successful in this regard. The "View Saved Covers" section also required us to write a small amount of HTML.

We created ROMCOM's functionality almost exclusively by switching between "driver/navigator" rolls. This was really important for our learning process in order to reinforce our understanding of new concepts. For instance, we both feel that our grasp of git workflow has markedly increased as well as JavaScript core concepts like functions and for loops. 

### Future Goals
If we were to continue working on the project, the user form specifically could use more development to make it more user friendly and we realize that a language filter would be a great addition to the user cover generator in order to keep content appropriate. Also, utilizing cookies so that the user's saved data isn't lost on reload would be a major improvement.

### In Closing
In our post-Covid time this project has been a breath of fresh air and much welcomed romance into our lives. Thank you for reading our book covers.
